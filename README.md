Overview

This project is a simple Hello World program built in JavaScript. While small, it represents the starting point of my journey as a software engineer. Every big system begins with the basics, and this project helps me practice version control, project setup, and documentation.

The purpose of this software is to print out a greeting message, showing how code can generate real output. It may be simple, but it sets the foundation for building larger and more complex applications in the future.
